# Stack and Queue Implementation

## UC1
Ability to create a Stack of 56 -> 30 -> 70
- Use LinkedList to do the Stack
  Operations
- Here push will internally call add method
  on LinkedList.
- So 70 will be added first then 30 and
  then 56 to make 56 on top of the Stack

## UC2
Ability to peek and pop from the Stack till it is empty
56 -> 30 -> 70
- Use LinkedList to do the Stack Operations

## UC3
Ability to create a Queue of 56 -> 30 -> 70
- Use LinkedList to do the Queue Operations
- Here enqueue will internally call append method on LinkedList.
- So 56 will be added first then 30 and then 70 to make 56 on top of the Stack

## UC4
Ability to dequeue from the beginning
-Use LinkedList to do the Queue Operations
